## My personal blog project
- this is my blog project and i am using some cool tech for it

1. GULP - a gulp build i created called SUMACH
2. A styleguide wich i will use for every new project
3. A Scss structure homemade

- I am missing a view logic was thinking Mustache or Polimer or something that allows me to use componenets

- I am also missing a controller logic


## Code is open source as you can see and i am not gitignoring the development part
